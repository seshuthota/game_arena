## Tips and Best Practices

### Efficient Navigation

**Quick Analysis Workflow:**
1. Start with the leaderboard to identify interesting players

- **Use browser back/forward** to quickly jump between analyzed positions
- **Right-click game cards** to open in new tabs for comparison
- **Use browser zoom** to adjust board size for your preference

### Analysis Techniques

**Studying Openings:**

2. Compare how different models handle the same openings
3. Look for patterns in successful vs unsuccessful games
4. Note which models prefer which opening systems

**Studying Endgames:**
1. Use the move length filter to find long games
2. Jump to the endgame positions using the move slider
3. Compare endgame technique between models
